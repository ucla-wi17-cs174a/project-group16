Controlling this Graphics Object: 
<ul><li>Animation is paused when this program starts, so first you should press ALT+a to play or pause animation. <li>
    Press t to un-hide the heads-up-display text.  **If this doesn't do anything** then you are running your files without correctly hosting them.  You need to 
    run cd path/to/these/files, then python -m http.server, then visit the URL localhost:8000. <li>
    Clicking and dragging spins the scene around while the camera stays still.  If you'd like to spin around some other focal point, 
    you can set one by flying the camera right up to a desired point and then pressing o.<li>
		Fly the camera around the scene to adjust your vantage point using the keys w a s d to move in the plane that's along the ground, 
		and the keys space and z to float up and down.  At any time press r to reset the camera and vantage point back to the origin. <li>
		The f key unfreezes the camera's rotation setting so you can aim it around while flying or sitting still.  Move the mouse around away from the 
		center of the window to steer, and press f again to stop this and to freeze the steering again.  Any roll rotation is controlled separately with the comma and period keys. <li> 
    The keys ALT+n and ALT+g switch shading behaviors.  ALT+n directly shows you normal vectors on shapes by interpreting X,Y,Z vectors
    as R,G,B colors.  ALT+g toggles Gouraud shading vs Smooth Phong shading with textures.<li>
		Press up and down to cycle through a live feed of important strings and values of the program -- the code for each Displayable object includes a function where it can provide these. <li>
		Have fun.
