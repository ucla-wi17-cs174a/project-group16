# Plan of attack:

I think we need to approach the development of this game like this:

1. Make fish into a sphere
2. Make it so that we can navigate the fish in a 3D world, moving in the direction of our heading
3. Add in bounds to the world & light it
4. Add other moving spheres to the world (aka other fish)
5. Add collision detection
6. Add game functionality (ie scores, grow / die upon collision)
7. Add fish geometry / texture
8. Add main menu screen and scoreboard
