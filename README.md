# project-group16: Flashy Fish

## How to play this game

1. You play a fish which starts at size 1. Every fish that you eat increases your size by 0.1 and your score by 1. 

2. Use your mouse to 'set' which direction your fish faces, and wasd keys to move the fish.

3. When you collide with a larger fish, your size resets to 1

4. You can collect powerups and use them to move faster or be invisible (for a short period of time)

## Some Advanced Topics

1. Bump mapping (for fish/fish scales)

2. Collision detection (between our fish and enemy fish)

## Other notes 

1. Imported fish model from .obj file (obj file from internet)

2. There are two powerups - invicibility and speed
